# Snake Game
***
## Project Description
I have created a basic snake game for fun using Python and PyGame. In the next part I will train an
AI to lear how to play this snake game.

## Prerequisites
Inorder to run this game you need to have Python and PyGame installed on your system. You can install
the desired version from [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

After Python is installed, run the following command to get PyGame
```commandline
pip install pygame
```

## How to install and use this project
This project is not an installable package. To play this snake game just clone the repository and
run ```main.py``` file. Don't change the file structure as it will affect the game. Games settings
like colors, window sizes and snake speed can be changed in ```settings.py``` file.
